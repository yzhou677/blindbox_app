# Collection Architecture Notes

Last updated: 2026-07

This document records intentional Collection architecture decisions, tradeoffs, and future scaling considerations.

The purpose is to preserve design intent and prevent future contributors from accidentally "fixing" behavior that is currently working as designed.

Durable product semantics now live in:

- [`PDR-001: Collector Type Semantics`](decisions/product/PDR-001-collector-type-semantics.md)
- [`PDR-002: Completion Semantics`](decisions/product/PDR-002-completion-semantics.md)

This file remains the implementation contract for resolver policy, thresholds,
snapshot compatibility, and collection-specific architecture.

---

## Current Status

Collection is considered:

**Stable / Maintenance Mode**

Core functionality is complete (see also [`ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md`](ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md) § Collection Feature Status for the current feature matrix and low-priority deferrals):

* Collection shelf
* Ownership tracking
* Wishlist tracking
* Custom series
* Custom figure support (create, edit, **add figure** from edit sheet)
* Brand filter
* IP filter
* Shelf browse (search, sort, collapsible buckets)
* Collection insights
* Collector identity
* Journey system
* Canonicalized custom taxonomy
* Edit custom series
* Input hardening

Future work should prioritize:

* Bug fixes
* UX polish
* Catalog expansion
* Performance profiling

Avoid major architectural rewrites unless real-world usage demonstrates a need.

---

## Intentional Architecture Decisions

### Single Snapshot Persistence

Collection data is stored as a single serialized snapshot in SharedPreferences.

Reasons:

* Simplicity
* Reliability
* Offline-first behavior
* Small expected data volume

Current architecture is considered appropriate for:

* Typical collectors
* Hundreds of figures
* Low-frequency edits

Future scaling should be evaluated using real-world collection sizes rather than theoretical limits.

---

### Collector Identity Is A Snapshot

Collector identity is intentionally not recomputed continuously.

Behavior:

* User explicitly reveals identity
* Identity is cached
* Metadata edits do not automatically overwrite the revealed identity

Reason:

The feature is intended to feel like a collectible personality reveal, not a constantly fluctuating dashboard.

Evolution is surfaced separately through Evolution Hints.

See **Collector Type Architecture** below for the full Live vs Snapshot contract.

---

### Journey History Is Historical

Collector Journey metrics are **historical by design**. The Journey card is
recomputed live from memory, but values represent the collector’s path — not
current shelf composition.

| Metric | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **Started** | First series added (`firstSeriesAddedAt`) |
| **Explored IP universes** | Unique IPs ever explored (`ipSeriesDepth.length`) — **append-only**; does **not** decrease when series are removed |
| **Identity** (Collector Type) | Snapshot at last reveal — separate from Journey |

Do **not** “fix” Explored to equal unique IPs currently on the shelf.

Journey **taxonomy depth** (`ipSeriesDepth`) records what happened when series
were added. Editing metadata later does not rewrite those events.

Separately: the **Collector Journey UI** on Insights is intentionally **LIVE**
(rebuilt from current memory + snapshot) and is **not** part of the Collector
Type reveal snapshot. Do not freeze Journey into Identity or RevealRecord.

See **Collector Type Architecture** below.

Example:

Series added under:

Baby Three

may later be edited to:

THE MONSTERS

Current shelf:

* Shows THE MONSTERS

Historical journey depth:

* May still reference Baby Three exploration

This is intentional.

Journey depth reflects collection history, not current taxonomy state.

---

## Collector Type Architecture

Canonical code: `lib/features/collection/insights/`.

This section exists so future maintainers do **not** “fix” Journey into a
reveal snapshot or re-derive Because copy from archetype switches.

### ADR: Snapshot invalidation is not identity inference

1. Signature exists only to determine whether a reveal is needed.
2. Resolver is the sole authority for interpreting the current shelf.
3. Identity stability applies only when no new reveal is required.
4. A reveal triggered by `needsReveal` must always persist the resolver's current interpretation.

Do not reintroduce `sameSignature` (or any other evolution gate) into the
`needsReveal` → Reveal path. Evolution answers *how* to present change on an
unchanged shelf only.

### Live state vs reveal snapshot

| Kind | Object | Behavior |
| ---- | ------ | -------- |
| **Live (Hero)** | `CollectorTypeIdentity` | Frozen until the user reveals again. Drives Hero, ceremony, At a Glance / Shelf Progress / Brand Distribution. |
| **Live (Journey)** | Collector Journey summary | Always current. **Not** archived with reveal. Updates as the shelf evolves. |
| **Historical replay** | `CollectorTypeRevealRecord` | Append-only resolve snapshot for Timeline / Personality Memory. No 1.0 UI yet. |

### Collection Summary vs Insights “At a glance”

Both surfaces show counts, but they answer different questions. Labels must name
what is counted — never bare “Figures”, “Series”, or “Wishlist”.

| Surface | Intent | Metrics |
| ------- | ------ | ------- |
| **Collection Summary** (Collection tab) | Shelf activity — what you own and what you are aiming for | Owned Figures · Wishlisted Figures · Completed Series · Master Complete |
| **Insights — At a glance** | Achievement snapshot at last reveal — collector identity | Owned Figures · Completed Series · Master Complete · Secrets Collected |

Same completion tiers (`countShelfCompletionTiers` / `resolveSeriesCompletion`);
At a glance omits wishlist and uses secrets collected instead. Values in At a
glance come from `CollectorTypeStats` frozen at reveal **when**
`collectorTypeStatsVersion == kCollectorTypeStatsVersion` (currently **2**) and
required fields are present. Otherwise Insights **live-derives** display stats
from the current shelf without rewriting prefs — identity (archetype / reason /
signature / reveal time / history) stays frozen. Outdated stats schema also
sets `needsReveal` so the user can formally refresh the snapshot.

### Collector Journey as a diary

Journey highlights memorable collector moments — not another stats panel.
**Open today’s collection diary** — not a dashboard of every signal.

| Beat | Source | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Started | `firstSeriesAddedAt` | Stable slot |
| Explored | `ipSeriesDepth` | Stable slot |
| Latest Memory | Existing memory only | Omit when none |

**Latest Memory priority** (no new persistence):

1. Master Complete — latest completed series is still Master Complete on shelf
2. Completed Series — `lastCompletedSeriesId` + `lastCompletedAtMs`
3. First Secret — `firstSecretOwnedAtMs`

**Diary principle (permanent):** surface at most **one or two** memorable
moments at a time. Journey can grow (First Master Complete, First New Universe,
Type Evolution) but must stay curated — never a six-row stats dump.

### Shelf Progress progressive disclosure

Shelf Progress answers **collection progression** (Regular Complete → Master Complete).

| Stage | Condition | Rows |
| ----- | --------- | ---- |
| 1 | Always | **Regular Progress** — mean of canonical `progressRatio` across **all** shelf series |
| 2 | `masterCompleteSeriesCount > 0` | **👑 Master Completion** — Master Complete / **Secret-bearing** series only |

**Formulas (canonical):**

```text
Regular Progress:
  mean over all shelf series of resolveSeriesCompletion(...).progressRatio
  (Secrets do not reduce a Regular-complete series below 100%)

Master Completion:
  masterCompleteSeriesCount / masterEligibleSeriesCount
  where masterEligibleSeriesCount = series with secretSlotCount > 0
  (no-Secret series are excluded from the denominator)

Near Complete:
  !isCompleted && progressRatio >= 0.85
  (same definition for Completion sort, atmosphere, and interpretShelf)
```

If `masterEligibleSeriesCount == 0`, do not show the Master Completion row.
Do **not** show Master Completion at `0%` before the first Master Complete —
progressive disclosure until `masterCompleteSeriesCount > 0`.

**Do not:**

* Make Journey a reveal-frozen field
* Recompute Collector Type continuously on every shelf edit
* Drive Because text from `switch (archetype)` in widgets

### Resolve pipeline

```
Shelf Snapshot
      ↓
Resolver (`resolveCollectorType`)
      ↓
CollectorTypeResolution  (scoreboard + reasonKey + confidence)
      ↓
shouldEvolve (evolution gate)
      ↓
CollectorTypeIdentity    (what the Hero shows)
      +
CollectorTypeRevealRecord (what History can replay)
      ↓
CollectorTypeCopy.becauseLineFor / becauseLineForRecord
      ↓
Hero / Reveal ceremony / (future) Timeline / Personality Memory
```

### Historical replay

```
RevealRecord (archetype, reasonKey, score, confidence, signature, resolverVersion, …)
      ↓
Timeline / Personality Memory
```

Replay answers “why were you The Loyalist then?” from the stored record — **never**
by re-running today’s Resolver over an old shelf.

### Product rules (intentional)

1. **Journey is intentionally LIVE as a card, HISTORICAL as metrics.** Recomputed from memory each build, but Explored / Started describe the collector’s path over time (append-only IP depth) — not current shelf composition. Do not freeze Journey into the reveal archive, and do not shrink Explored on series remove.
2. **Identity is intentionally SNAPSHOTTED.** Explicit reveal; Evolution Hints nudge re-reveal; `shouldEvolve` gates type changes (Still keeps title, refreshes stats/signature/reason).
3. **UI never switches on archetype for causal copy.** Title/accent/flavor may read archetype catalog metadata; **Because** must not.
4. **`reasonKey` is the only explanation source** for Because. Map via `CollectorTypeCopy` only (`becauseLineFor` / `becauseLineForRecord`).
5. **`resolverVersion` protects historical semantics.** Stamped on every `CollectorTypeRevealRecord`. Policy and bump rules live on `kCollectorTypeResolverVersion` — schema/policy version, not app version. Bump only when the same shelf could resolve to a different identity or explanation.
6. **Identity scores the current shelf only (2.0+).** Resolver must not read Journey memory (`ipSeriesDepth`, `firstSeriesAddedAt`, …) or Reveal History. Prior Identity is allowed only inside `shouldEvolve`. Catalog metadata may join shelf items (Trend Chaser freshness). Scoring signal table lives as a comment on `collector_type_resolver.dart` and below.
7. **Identity requires defining behavior (6.0).** Signals are evidence, not identity. Eligibility uses majority / clear dominance / repeated evidence before strength and soft-capped scale. Absolute counts alone never assign personality. Every threshold must be explainable in user language (see § Collector Types below).
8. **Reveal lifecycle (5.2):** Hero shows **last revealed** identity (persisted). Live shelf continuously resolves a **candidate** (`collectorTypeLiveResolutionProvider`) that is never auto-persisted. `needsReveal` is true when **signature** drifts, **resolverVersion** changed, or **stats schema** is outdated — signature answers **When** only. Signature always includes currently-recent catalog template ids (`|r:`) so Trend aging can invalidate without rewriting identity on launch. A reveal while `needsReveal` always persists the resolver candidate (no `sameSignature` Still override). `shouldEvolve` (margin / cooldown / sameSignature) applies only to repeated reveals on an unchanged shelf. Persist only on explicit Reveal.
9. **Evolution:** On unchanged-shelf reveals, `shouldEvolve` answers whether the challenger earned the title. Confidence remains on `CollectorTypeResolution` for analytics only. Ceremony reflects whether the persisted archetype changed.

Related: evolution constants in `collector_type_evolution_gate.dart`; scoring thresholds in `collector_type_resolver.dart`; prefs key `collection_memory_v3`. Canonical registry: `CollectorTypeArchetypes` (**10 types**).

### Collector Types (resolver 6.1) — 10 archetypes

Each type answers: **what clearly defines this collector’s shelf today?**  
Pipeline: **Signals → Eligibility → Strength → Soft-capped scale → Winner.**  
Absolute counts alone never assign identity. Journey / Reveal History stay out of scoring.

#### Canonical metrics

Use canonical Regular-weighted completion (`resolveSeriesCompletion` / `aggregateShelfCompletion`). Avoid division by zero. Unknown/untracked figure states are **not** owned or wishlist.

| Metric | Definition |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `completedRatio` | `completedSeriesCount / trackedSeriesCount` |
| `nearCompleteRatio` | `nearCompleteSeriesCount / trackedSeriesCount` |
| `secretHitRate` | `secretOwnedCount / totalSecretSlotCount` (**Secret slots**, not all figures) |
| `dominantIpShare` | largest series count in one taxonomy IP / total shelf series |
| `customRatio` | `customSeriesCount / total shelf series` |
| `wishlistRatio` | `wishlistFigureCount / (ownedFigureCount + wishlistFigureCount)` — tracked intent only |
| `recentRatio` | `recentCatalogSeriesCount / total shelf series` (releaseDate within **90** days) |
| `averageRegularCompletion` | mean Regular `progressRatio` across shelf series |

`isNearComplete` = `!isCompleted && progressRatio >= 0.85`.

#### Threshold philosophy (user language)

| Number | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `2` | One occurrence may be incidental; two demonstrates repeated behavior |
| `>50%` | The behavior genuinely defines the shelf (tie is not dominance) |
| `60%` | Clear dominance — at least three of every five |
| `70%` | Most of a small shelf is meaningfully completed (refined, not merely new) |
| `85%` | Close enough to feel like the final push toward completion |
| `90 days` | Current three-month release cycle |
| `3 IPs` | Real multi-universe breadth (two may be a simple pair) |
| `≤4 series` | Early-stage shelf where luck can still define identity |

#### Eligibility (product contract)

| Type | Product sentence | Eligibility |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **Completionist** | Completion defines your shelf | ≥2 completed **and** `completedRatio ≥ 0.60`; else ≥2 near-complete **and** `nearCompleteRatio ≥ 0.60` |
| **Hunter** | You actively hunt Secrets—and you catch them | **>4** series, ≥2 Secrets, Secret slots > 0, `secretHitRate ≥ 0.50` |
| **Lucky One** | Luck found you before hunting did | `!Hunter`, **≤4** series, ≥1 Secret, `secretHitRate ≥ 0.50` (Hunter’s prequel) |
| **Loyalist** | One universe clearly defines your shelf | `dominantIpShare ≥ 0.60` **and** ≥2 series in that IP (brand fallback only if most rows lack IP — never multi-IP POP MART as Loyalist) |
| **Curator** | You thoughtfully build across multiple universes, giving each one room to grow | `!Loyalist`, ≥3 distinct taxonomy IPs, `averageRegularCompletion ≥ 0.50` |
| **Wanderer** | You’re still discovering what defines your shelf | **Fallback only** — soft board floor (score 5) for Still/evolution; never beats specialized bases (≥28). Empty / early / one-series / mixed undefined shelves |
| **Minimalist** | You keep a small, focused shelf and care deeply for what makes the cut | ≤3 series **and** `averageRegularCompletion ≥ 0.70` (**no** owned-figure cap) |
| **Worldbuilder** | Your own creations define your shelf | ≥2 custom series **and** `customRatio > 0.50`; notes/covers/photos deepen **after** eligibility (custom rows only) |
| **Dreamer** | You dream about what comes next more than what you already own | ≥2 wishlist figures **and** `wishlistRatio > 0.50` |
| **Trend Chaser** | Recent releases define your shelf | ≥2 recent catalog series (≤90 days) **and** `recentRatio > 0.50` |

#### Why each gate (plain language)

| Type | Why these numbers |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| **Completionist** | Two completes prove repeated finishing; 60% means finishing defines the shelf. Near path uses the same share with 85% “final push.” No separate avg≥70% gate once 60% of the shelf is fully complete. |
| **Hunter** | Two Secrets + ≥50% hit rate on a shelf past early stage (`>4` series). Lucky One’s sequel. |
| **Lucky One** | Early fortune on ≤4 series; progresses to Hunter when the shelf grows past 4 with repeated Secret catches. |
| **Loyalist** | 60% IP share is clear universe dominance; ≥2 series in that IP is returning, not a one-off. Brand must not classify multi-IP POP MART shelves. |
| **Curator** | Three IPs establish real breadth; 50% avg Regular shows investment, not sampling. |
| **Wanderer** | Honest fallback when no specialized identity clearly qualifies — not a “failed” collector. |
| **Minimalist** | Small **and** refined; figure count varies by roster size and must not gate. |
| **Worldbuilder** | Two customs prove authorship; >50% means self-created worlds dominate (exactly 50% is a tie). |
| **Dreamer** | Two wishlist marks prove intention; >50% means wanting more than owning defines tracked intent. |
| **Trend Chaser** | Two recent series + majority recent; 90 days = current cycle. Aging out of the window changes signature → `needsReveal`. |

#### Relationships

- **Hunter ⊥ Lucky One** — progression by shelf stage: ≤4 → Lucky One; >4 + ≥2 Secrets → Hunter. Hunter eligible → Lucky One score is zero.  
- **Loyalist ⊥ Curator** — Loyalist eligible → Curator score is zero  
- **Wanderer** does not compete as a dominance archetype  

Other types may qualify simultaneously; winner uses eligible strength + deterministic tie-break.

#### Score shape (eligible only)

1. Base score indicates valid eligibility  
2. Primary strength from the same behavior that established eligibility  
3. Absolute counts only as small soft-capped scale bonuses  
4. No uncapped count term may dominate all other identities  
5. Eligible archetypes compete in a comparable score band  

Examples: Completionist ← completed/near ratio (+ capped count); Hunter ← hit rate (+ capped Secret count); Loyalist ← IP share; Curator ← IP breadth + avg Regular (capped); Minimalist ← completion within small-shelf gate; Worldbuilder ← custom ratio + capped authorship; Dreamer ← wishlist ratio; Trend ← recent ratio (+ capped recent count).

#### Collector-facing Because copy (via `reasonKey` only)

| Type | Because line (representative) |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |
| Completionist | Because completion defines your shelf. / Because most of your shelf is at the edge of complete. |
| Hunter | Because you actively hunt Secrets—and you catch them. |
| Lucky One | Because luck found you before hunting did. |
| Loyalist | Because one universe clearly defines your shelf. |
| Curator | Because your shelf is a gallery of worlds you genuinely invest in. |
| Wanderer | Because your shelf is still discovering what defines it. |
| Minimalist | Because you keep a small, focused shelf and care deeply for what makes the cut. |
| Worldbuilder | Because your own creations define your shelf. |
| Dreamer | Because you dream about what comes next more than what you already own. |
| Trend Chaser | Because recent releases define your shelf. |

UI must call `CollectorTypeCopy.becauseLineFor` / `becauseLineForRecord` — never `switch` on archetype for causal copy.

#### Removed / obsolete (do not reintroduce)

- Completionist ~40% finish gates or extra avg≥70% after majority-complete  
- Hunter ~35% “density” over all figures / vague secrets-theme bypass for one Secret  
- Brand-first Loyalist (POP MART multi-IP → Loyalist)  
- Curator at only 2 brands/IPs without investment  
- Wanderer requiring ≥2 brands/IPs/series or low completion  
- Minimalist `ownedFigureCount ≤ 12`  
- Worldbuilder ~30% custom gate  
- Dreamer ~45% wishlist gate  
- Trend **180**-day window or weak one-recent / ~40% recent paths  

**Not Identity signals:** Journey `ipSeriesDepth` / `firstSeriesAddedAt`; Reveal History / prior Identity (except `shouldEvolve`).

**Legacy id migration (persist load):** `archivist` → Worldbuilder; `daydreamCollector` → Dreamer. Stylist removed (no successor mapping).

**Tie-break order (high → low):** Completionist → Hunter → Loyalist → Curator → Worldbuilder → Minimalist → Trend Chaser → Dreamer → Lucky One → Wanderer.

**Tie-break role:** Insurance when scores tie within epsilon. Structural exclusions never both score. Worldbuilder ranks above Minimalist on authorship.

### ipSeriesDepth Is Add-Time History

`ipSeriesDepth`

tracks the IP associated with a series when it was first introduced into the collection.

It is **append-only**: series removal does not decrement counts or drop IP keys.
**Explored IP universes** = `ipSeriesDepth.length` (unique IPs ever explored).

It is not currently migrated when a user edits taxonomy metadata.

Reason:

Depth measures exploration history rather than current categorization / shelf
composition.

Future migration support may be added if user feedback indicates confusion.

---

### Custom Metadata Ownership

Custom series belong to the user.

Users are allowed to:

* Edit series name
* Edit brand
* Edit IP
* Edit notes
* Change cover image
* Attach local figure photos

**Product boundary:** series notes, custom covers, and local figure photos are
available on **custom series only**. Official catalog series tracked onto the
shelf do not expose those editors — do not document or test catalog rows as if
they carried user notes/covers.

The application should not attempt to second-guess or override user intent.

Catalog data remains authoritative.

Custom data remains user-controlled.

---

### Series figures sheet progress (Regular ≠ Secret)

**Product decision:** The Series figures sheet presents collection progress from
the collector’s perspective, not the database’s.

Regular Figures and Secret Figures are **two different collection goals**. Do
**not** summarize them into a single `X of Y Figures` value.

The UI should consistently answer **“What am I still collecting?”** instead of
exposing how many figure rows exist in the database.

| Surface | Behavior |
| ------- | -------- |
| Sheet header | `Regular Figures N of M Collected`; show `Secret Figures A of B Collected` **only if** `ownedSecretCount > 0` (never `0 of N` in the header) |
| Section headers | Same Regular / Secret split; progress `(owned of total)` — including `0 of N` when secrets exist but none owned |
| No secrets | Omit Secret lines and Secret section entirely |
| Complete / Master Complete | Unchanged — still from `resolveSeriesCompletion` |

Presentation only — do not change completion calculation or Collector Type logic. Header Secret summary is ownership-gated; the Secret figures section body is not.

---

### Flat shelf sorting

Collection sorting operates on a **flat** series list per bucket.

The Collection page is organized as:

```
Collection
    ↓
Bucket (In Progress / Completed)
        ↓
Flat List<ShelfSeries>
        ↓
One global comparator
        ↓
Render (series rail)
```

Sort modes do **not** group by IP. IP filters remain available as a filter facet only — they do not affect display order after the list is built.

#### Collection sorting reference

| Sort | Series comparator | Tie-breakers |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Recently Added | Preserve shelf / bucket encounter order | N/A |
| Alphabetical (A–Z) | Series name (case-insensitive) | shelf `id` |
| Figure Count | `figureCount` (desc) | series name → shelf `id` |
| Completion | **Tier first:** Master Complete → Complete → Near Complete (`!isCompleted && progressRatio ≥ 0.85`) → In Progress; then progress ratio (desc) | series name → shelf `id` |

**Product rule:** Collection sorting is flat. New sort modes should define a **series-level** comparator — not reintroduce hidden IP aggregates.

Implementation: [`sortShelfSeriesForDisplay`](../lib/features/collection/presentation/collection_shelf_browse.dart) in `collection_shelf_browse.dart`.

**The Collection page is a flat series browser within each progress bucket.**

## Known Tradeoffs

### Journey vs Current Shelf

Possible:

Current Shelf ≠ Historical Journey

This is expected.

---

### Collector Identity vs Live Shelf

Possible:

Live Shelf ≠ Cached Identity

This is expected.

Revealing again updates identity.

---

### Snapshot Size Growth

Current storage is optimized for simplicity rather than extreme scale.

Monitor:

* cold start time
* snapshot size
* save latency

before introducing:

* local databases
* split persistence
* paging
* isolate serialization

---

## Future Evaluation Triggers

Consider architecture review if any of the following become common:

* > 200 series
* > 1000 figures
* snapshot size > 1 MB
* noticeable startup delay
* noticeable save delay
* user requests journey history migration
* user confusion around collector identity caching

Until then:

**Prefer simplicity over infrastructure complexity.**

---

## Collector Type 6.1

Status: **Active** policy version (`kCollectorTypeResolverVersion = 6.1`).

Final behavior contract (6.0 base + **6.1** Lucky One → Hunter progression):
Lucky One is ≤4 series; Hunter requires **>4** series with ≥2 Secrets at ≥50% hit.
IP-first Loyalist, Curator as multi-IP investment, Wanderer as fallback only,
Secret hit rate over Secret slots, Trend = 90 days with signature `|r:` aging.
Full eligibility table, metrics, and removed obsolete gates: **§ Collector Types**
above.

Reveal lifecycle remains **5.2**; tie-break order unchanged from **5.3**
(Worldbuilder above Minimalist). Do not silently rewrite persisted identity on
launch — old reveals trigger `needsReveal` via resolver-version invalidation.

See **ADR: Snapshot invalidation is not identity inference** above.

**Reveal lifecycle (5.2):** Signature / `needsReveal` answer **When** only. A
reveal while `needsReveal` always persists the resolver candidate.
`shouldEvolve` (margin / cooldown / sameSignature) applies only to repeated
reveals on an unchanged shelf.

**Tie-break (5.3):** Worldbuilder ranks above Minimalist when scores tie —
authorship over compact shelf size. Structural pairs Hunter/Lucky and
Loyalist/Curator never both score.

**Evolution (unchanged-shelf):** `shouldEvolve` compares candidate vs previous
identity via scoreboard margin (and cooldown-scaled margin). Wanderer’s soft
floor keeps Still from treating fallback identity as “absent from board.”
Resolution.confidence is analytics-only.

**Behavior inference (6.0):** Identity answers “what clearly defines this
collector’s shelf today?” Eligibility (majority / clear dominance / repeated
evidence) precedes strength and soft-capped scale. Absolute counts alone never
assign identity. Every threshold must be explainable in user language.

**Worldbuilder:** authorship-first — `≥2 custom` and `customRatio > 0.50`.
Notes/covers/photos deepen score only on custom series.

Do not adjust scoring without product evidence from real collectors. Prefer
eligibility / composition fixes over arbitrary weight nerfs.

Future work should build on this architecture rather than expand the resolver.
